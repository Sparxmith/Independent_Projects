# Today, Monday, August 13, 2018, I learned:

###  VIM:
- To use RegEx group references in *Search & Replace*, you must remember the following important points:
   - The quantity modifier for 1 or more is `\+`, not just `+`; i.e., `\d+` becomes `\d\+`
   - To use the grouping effect, use `\(foo\)` not just `(foo)`
   - To call a group, use `\1` not `$1` or `\$1`
- To place your cursor at the end of a search result, add `/e`.  For example:  `/foo/e` will place it on the second ‘o’
- When using the ‘substitute` feature (`:%s/foo/bar/g`), some characters must be escaped to use their `regex` meanings:
>    ., *, \, [, ^, and $ are metacharacters
>   +, ?, |, &, {, (, and ) must be escaped to use their special functions
(From [the Vim Wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Search_and_replace)

### PHP & MySQL:
- If you're passing an array of strings of digits to a MySQL statement through a PHP script, you must enclose each cell with `"'<numbers>'"`  
   - The regex for this is `("'\d+'")`

### Git:
- When using `git commit -m`, you need to escape the backtick in BASH to have it appear in the Commit Message, otherwise BASH will attempt to execute commands based on what's between the backticks.
