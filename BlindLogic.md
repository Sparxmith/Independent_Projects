# Logic without Pictures

## Description 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) describes *Aphantasia* as "a condition where one does not possess a functioning mind's eye and cannot voluntarily visualize imagery."  Although this may seem like a crippling condition to those who think visually, for most people with Aphantasia the condition does not inhibit learning, cognitive ability, or technical competence except in those cases where visualization is categorically necessary.  For example, an engineer with Aphantasia is typically no less capable than an engineer without Aphantasia.  However, individuals with Aphantasia seldom become artists, architects, or cartographers, as their limitations with visualization self-select these individuals out of those potential professions.   

The reason that Aphantasiac engineers are no less competent professionally is due to the adaptive capacity of the human brain.  Anecdotal evidence on the [Aphantasia subredit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphantasia) suggests that physiokinisthetic & spaciokinisthetic senses are coupled with Mathematical, Geometric, and Physics education to create the same capabilities as possessed by non-Aphantasiac engineers.

## Purpose
This document serves two purposes simultaneously:   
1. A reference for discussions with my supervisor who was appalled to discover that I could not visualize how a `Left Join` differed from an `Inner Join` in MySQL, in spite of the fact that I can use either operation as intended.  
2. A map of my internal representations regarding informal Set Theory, MySQL operations, and how I use these interrelated disciplines as a Back End software developer.
## Logic *with* Pictures
Picture a Venn Diagram.  Did it look like this?

Now picture a Venn Diagram with `A` on the left, `B` on the right, with `C` showing the Intersection.  Did it look like this?   
![C = A ∩ B](https://goo.gl/images/TsYkn6 "C = A ∩ B")
